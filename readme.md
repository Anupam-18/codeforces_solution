# Explanation
A complete pool of solved questions of codeforces Link to the question : http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/227/B Approach : Here, Linear search would give us the result but as we have to answer on the basis of m queries the overall complexity would be O(m*n) where m -> the no of queries n -> the no of elements in the array So I have thought of a solution in which I am precomputing the cost of search right in the start while inserting them into vectors and then answering the queries on the basis of precomputed values which makes this approach effective. For further clearance you can dry run the code.
